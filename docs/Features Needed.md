## Product Design Implications (Critical)

### Must Win On
1. **Speed** – add, find, update items in seconds  
2. **Clarity** – always know what stock exists  
3. **Mobile + scanning** – real-world usage, not desk-only  
4. **Predictable pricing** – no surprise tier jumps  

### Safe to Defer (Early Stages)
- AI forecasting
- Complex automation engines
- Advanced analytics
- Enterprise-grade APIs
