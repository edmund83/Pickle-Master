Below is a consolidated, decision-ready table distilled from Reddit findings (r/smallbusiness, r/InventoryManagement, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur), sorted by priority based on frequency, intensity of complaints, and business impact for small entrepreneurs.

Priority scale

P0 – Critical / Must-have (blocking adoption)

P1 – High (strong differentiator, repeated demand)

P2 – Medium (important but tolerable workaround exists)

P3 – Low (nice-to-have)

Inventory SaaS – Reddit-Derived Feature Priorities (Sorted)
Priority	Requested Feature	Pain Point (What Users Complain About)
P0	Affordable pricing for small teams	SaaS tools are “too expensive”, sudden price hikes (e.g. Sortly), forced tier jumps, cost not proportional to business size
P0	Simple, intuitive UI (non-technical friendly)	Tools are too complex, confusing for staff, “overkill ERP”, resistance from older or non-tech employees
P0	Real-time stock accuracy (single source of truth)	Inventory counts don’t match reality, lost items, outdated spreadsheets, manual errors
P0	Multi-user access (cloud-based)	Spreadsheets don’t support teams, overwrites, no audit trail, cannot scale beyond one person
P0	Basic item CRUD + fast updates	Too slow to add/update items, clunky workflows, time wasted on admin instead of business
P0	Low-stock alerts / reorder point notifications	Constant manual checking, stockouts, overbuying, “I just want an email when to reorder”
P1	Barcode / QR scanning via mobile	Manual SKU entry is slow and error-prone, no easy way to count or issue items
P1	Mobile app (iOS / Android / PWA)	Inventory happens on the floor/site, not at desktop; web-only tools fail in real life
P1	Check-in / check-out (asset & tool tracking)	Tools/materials go missing, no accountability, inventory systems focused only on “sales items”
P1	E-commerce integration (Shopify, WooCommerce)	Double entry, stock mismatches between store & warehouse
P1	Accounting integration (QuickBooks, Xero)	Messy COGS, inventory valuation issues, accountant complaints
P1	Bulk import/export (Excel/CSV)	Onboarding pain, migration friction, fear of switching tools
P1	Search & filtering (by SKU, name, custom fields)	Can’t find items fast, inventory grows unmanageable
P2	Custom fields (flexible schema)	Every business tracks different data (expiry, lot, location, job no.), tools are too rigid
P2	Basic reporting (stock value, usage, aging)	No visibility for decisions, spreadsheets needed for simple insights
P2	Historical inventory snapshots	Can’t answer “what was inventory value last month?” for accounting
P2	Role-based permissions	Everyone sees everything; no control over who can edit/delete
P2	Multi-location support	Growing businesses can’t separate warehouses, vans, job sites
P2	Purchase orders / supplier tracking	Reordering is manual, disconnected from stock levels
P3	Demand forecasting	Desired but not expected at SMB price point; workaround via Excel
P3	Manufacturing / BOM / raw material tracking	Needed only for makers/manufacturers; niche but valuable
P3	Advanced analytics / dashboards	Nice-to-have, not core buying decision
P3	API & webhooks	Mainly requested by tech-savvy founders or larger SMBs
P3	Automation rules (advanced workflows)	Power feature, but complexity scares small teams
Key Meta-Insights (Important for Product Strategy)

Price + simplicity beats features

SMBs will tolerate fewer features if the tool is affordable and dead simple.

Inventory ≠ just “products for sale”

Strong unmet need for tools, assets, materials, internal usage tracking.

Excel is the real competitor

Your SaaS must beat Excel on speed, clarity, and cost, not just features.

Mobile + barcode is a deal-breaker

If scanning is bad or missing → instant rejection.

Trust & predictability matter

Sudden pricing changes destroy goodwill more than missing features.
