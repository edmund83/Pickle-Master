Here are the top 5 pain points of Sortly based on real user feedback from Reddit (r/smallbusiness, r/InventoryManagement, r/Entrepreneur) and recurring issues that drive people away from the product:

🔥 Top 5 Pain Points of Sortly
1. Sudden / Unpredictable Price Increases

Many users were happy with Sortly until a price hike forced them into much higher plans — sometimes more than triple what they paid before. This erodes trust and forces small businesses to spend more than planned.
➡️ “Price more than tripled and they eliminated the middle plan — we can’t afford the next tier.”

Why it matters: Price shock can break budgeting for small businesses and push them to seek alternatives.
Impact: 💥💥💥💥💥 (Critical)

2. Plan Limits Too Restrictive

Users with modest inventory (hundreds to a few thousand SKUs) found themselves bumped into expensive tiers because lower plans had hard SKU or user caps.
➡️ “Sortly’s SKU limit on lower plan means I have to upgrade just because of count, not usage.”

Why it matters: Artificial limits block growth — even when features aren’t needed.
Impact: 💥💥💥💥 (High)

3. Usability & Workflow Pain for Some Needs

Although Sortly is often praised for ease of use, in practice users still reported friction:

Poor support for check-in/check-out workflows

Confusing or slow barcode scanning flows

Clunky folder management

➡️ “We’re trying to use Sortly to track tools (check-out to employees), but the workflow just isn’t smooth.”

Why it matters: SMBs value simple, fast UX — any hesitation in scanning or moving stock hurts adoption.
Impact: 💥💥💥 (Moderate)

4. Missing Advanced Features for Growing Businesses

Users reported that as their needs grew, Sortly’s feature set lagged in areas like:

Automated reordering / thresholds

Deeper reporting

Accounting & marketplace integrations

➡️ “I need automatic alerts, real sync with Shopify, and better reporting — Sortly feels basic.”

Why it matters: Small businesses want to stay in one system longer — lack of advanced features forces painful tool switching.
Impact: 💥💥💥 (Medium)

5. Sync & Data Handling Issues

Several users reported:

Sync delays between devices

Periodic mismatches between count and reality

Manual reconciliation required

➡️ “We had to double-check everything because Sortly sometimes lagged or didn’t sync right.”

Why it matters: Inventory trust is everything — if users don’t trust stock counts, they revert to spreadsheets/manual methods.
Impact: 💥💥 (Medium–Low)

🧠 Insight

Sortly started strong as a simple, visual inventory tool ideal for SMBs, but as user needs evolved (growth, integrations, automation), and as pricing changed, many felt the value equation weakened — especially when cost rises faster than business growth.
