PRIORITY 1 – MUST HAVE (Deal-breakers)

Priority: 1
Feature / Idea: Trust-first pricing (no forced tier jumps)
Why it steals Sortly users:
Sortly users are most angry about sudden 3×–4× price hikes and SKU cliffs. They don’t mind paying, but they hate being punished for growth.
What to do better:
• No hard SKU limits
• Usage-based or soft scaling pricing
• Price-lock guarantee (12–24 months)
Impact: Extremely high – this alone triggers churn

Priority: 2
Feature / Idea: Native check-in / check-out (asset tracking)
Why it steals Sortly users:
Sortly has no proper tool/asset workflow. Users hack folders and fail. Construction, events, IT, clinics all need this.
What to do better:
• Assign item to person / job / site
• Due date + reminders
• Scan to issue / scan to return
Impact: Extremely high – solves a real daily pain

Priority: 3
Feature / Idea: Offline-first mobile scanning
Why it steals Sortly users:
Inventory happens where internet is weak or missing. Sortly assumes constant connectivity, which breaks trust.
What to do better:
• Scan offline
• Queue changes
• Auto-sync with conflict handling
Impact: Very high – strong differentiator

PRIORITY 2 – STRONG DIFFERENTIATORS

Priority: 4
Feature / Idea: Excel-grade bulk editing without Excel risk
Why it steals Sortly users:
Excel is still used because Sortly bulk tools are weak and risky. Users fear breaking data.
What to do better:
• Spreadsheet-like grid
• Bulk edit + undo
• Preview diff before apply
Impact: High – reduces fear and friction

Priority: 5
Feature / Idea: Inventory trust layer (confidence indicators)
Why it steals Sortly users:
Users stop trusting numbers due to sync lag or human error. Once trust is gone, they churn.
What to do better:
• Last verified timestamp
• Who verified
• Confidence indicator (green/yellow/red)
Impact: High – emotional retention driver

Priority: 6
Feature / Idea: Simple automation rules (SMB-grade)
Why it steals Sortly users:
Sortly lacks automation; ERPs are too complex. SMBs want guardrails, not systems.
What to do better:
• If stock < X → notify
• If overdue → alert
• No scripting
Impact: Medium-high

PRIORITY 3 – CONVERSION ACCELERATORS

Priority: 7
Feature / Idea: One-click Sortly migration
Why it steals Sortly users:
Many users want to leave but fear setup pain. Migration friction traps them.
What to do better:
• Import folders, items, photos
• Preserve history
• Guided migration
Impact: Medium-high

Priority: 8
Feature / Idea: Predictable, honest positioning
Why it steals Sortly users:
SMBs hate “enterprise” language and feature bloat. They reward clarity and honesty.
What to do better:
• Clear: “Not an ERP”
• Clear limits
• Clear roadmap
Impact: Medium

Priority: 9
Feature / Idea: SMB-friendly integrations (not everything)
Why it steals Sortly users:
Users want Shopify + QuickBooks, not 50 integrations.
What to do better:
• Deep support for 2–3 key tools
• Reliable sync over breadth
Impact: Medium
