## Notes (for Pricing Page)

- **Starter** is intentionally limited to **single location** to keep entry pricing simple.
- **Growth** is the best plan for most small businesses (multi-location + operations features).
- **Scale** is for owners/managers who need controls (audit/approvals/permissions) and higher limits.
