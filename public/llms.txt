## About StockZip
StockZip is a simple, mobile-first inventory management system for small teams. It features barcode scanning, offline reliability, check-in/check-out workflows, and trust-first pricing with no surprise tier jumps.

## Positioning
"An inventory system your whole team can use in minutes — with barcode scanning, offline reliability, and pricing that doesn't punish growth."

## Core Promises
1. Speed: Add/find/update items fast (mobile + desktop)
2. Accuracy: Real-time stock you can trust (audit trail + verification)
3. Simplicity: Not an ERP; minimal setup; staff-friendly UI

## Key Differentiators
- Trust-first pricing (no surprise tier jumps, no hard SKU cliffs)
- Native check-in/check-out (true asset workflow, not folder hacks)
- Offline-first mobile scanning (real-world warehouse/jobsite reliability)
- Excel-grade bulk editing with guardrails (preview diffs + undo)
- Inventory trust layer (last verified + confidence indicators)
- 1-click migration (especially from Sortly)
