# StockZip

> A simple, mobile-first inventory management system for small teams with barcode scanning, offline reliability, check-in/check-out workflows, and trust-first pricing that doesn't punish growth.

StockZip helps teams manage inventory fast with three core promises: Speed (add, find, and update items quickly on mobile and desktop), Accuracy (real-time stock you can trust with full audit trail and verification), and Simplicity (not an ERP, minimal setup, staff-friendly UI).

Key differentiators include trust-first pricing with no surprise tier jumps or hard SKU cliffs, native check-in/check-out workflows for true asset tracking, offline-first mobile scanning for warehouse and jobsite reliability, Excel-grade bulk editing with preview diffs and undo, an inventory trust layer with last-verified timestamps and confidence indicators, and 1-click migration from competitors like Sortly.

Target users include small business owners and founders seeking budget-friendly simplicity, operations and warehouse managers needing accuracy and scanning, field and construction teams requiring asset check-in/check-out with offline mode, and ecommerce operators wanting stock sync and inventory truth.

Technical capabilities include multi-location hierarchical organization (warehouse to shelf to bin), real-time stock movements with audit trail, low stock alerts with min/max thresholds, barcode and QR code scanning with generation and batch printing for thermal printers, team collaboration with mentions and notifications, multi-tenant security with RLS isolation and RBAC, and mobile-first touch and camera interfaces.
